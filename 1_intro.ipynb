    "The hydrogen molecular ion (HMI) consists of one electron and two protons (with an equilibrium internuclear distance of approximately $2a_0$), instead of one electron and proton of the hydrogen atom. Although the HMI is technically a three-body problem (which cannot be solved exactly), with the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, the previously unsolvable quantum system becomes solvable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the HMI is greatly simplified through the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, obtaining the exact analytical solution is incredibly demanding in mathematical prowess and, more importantly, patience. However, through differential equation solvers such as the one included in SciPy, we can obtain the nearly-exact solution to HMI. \n",

    "During the process of manipulating the time-independent Schrodinger equation, numerically solving the required parameters, and examining the nearly-exact solution, a deeper insight into chemical bonding can be formed.\n",

    "As the HMI consists of one electron and two protons, this quantum system can also be thought of as the problem below.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Imagine a stable Helium-2 ion $^{2}\\text{He}^{+}$ with one electron. Initially, the wavefunction of the electron is the typical hydrogen-like atomic orbitals. As you forcefully tear the two protons of the nucleus apart, the electron wavefunction slowly distorts to reflect the changing Hamiltonian. When the two protons are separated by a distance of $2a_0$, the electron wave function is that of the familiar HMI treated in physical/quantum chemistry textbooks. As the two protons continue to be separated, this system closely resembles that of the infinitely separated neutral hydrogen atom and proton.\n",
