    "\n",
    "The hydrogen molecular ion (HMI) consists of one electron and two protons (with an equilibrium internuclear distance of approximately $2a_0$), instead of one electron and proton of the hydrogen atom. Although the HMI is technically a three-body problem (which cannot be solved exactly), the Born-Oppenheimer approximation allows the quantum system to be solvable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, obtaining the exact analytical solution is incredibly demanding in mathematical prowess and, more importantly, patience. However, through differential equation solvers such as the one included in SciPy, we can obtain the nearly-exact solution to HMI. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why solve the hydrogen molecular ion\n",
    "\n",
    "During the process of manipulating the time-independent Schrodinger equation, numerically solving the required parameters, and examining the nearly-exact solution, a deeper insight into chemical bonding can be formed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the HMI consists of one electron and two protons, this quantum system can also be thought of as the problem below.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Imagine a stable Helium-2 ion $^{2}\\text{He}^{+}$ with one electron. Initially, the wavefunction of the electron is one of the typical hydrogen-like atomic orbitals. \n",
    ">\n",
    ">As you forcefully tear the two protons of the nucleus apart, the electron wavefunction slowly distorts to reflect the changing Hamiltonian. When the two protons are separated by a distance of $2a_0$, the electron wave function is that of the familiar HMI treated in physical/quantum chemistry textbooks. \n",
    ">\n",
    ">At last, as the two protons continue to be separated, this system now closely resembles that of the infinitely separated proton and neutral hydrogen atom (again, think of hydrogen atomic orbitals).\n",
    "\n",
    "With the perspective offered above, it is clear that the hydrogen atom and HMI are deeply related to each other. This relationship will be investigated in the following notebooks as we uncover the HMI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the benefits of other methods, such as LCAO-MO, will be very apparent as the HMI is solved with the aforementioned, computationaly intensive method."
